<h1>C#</h1>
<p>C# is an object oriented programming language created by Microsoft. Primitive data types are stored in the stack, and reference types point to objects creates in the heap. References are permitted to have a null value.</p> 
<p>
Constructors initialize an object. They must have the same name as the class, must have no return type, can only be called using the new keyword and are optional (a no-arg constructor is provided when none are defined.</p>
<p>
Usage of this keyword refers to the specific object using it and helps prevent naming conflicts.</p>
