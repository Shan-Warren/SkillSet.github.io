<h1>CSS</h1>
<p>CSS occurs in the style element of an html page, within the head element.</p> 
<p>
It stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is used to describe how an html document appears as a webpage.</p>
<p>
It allows for negative margins, 0 is expressed without a unit, and measurement is based on the length of a unit and not another element.</p> 
<p>Absolute units include cm, in, px, points (pt) and picas (pc).</p>
